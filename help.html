<h2>What is TaskBit?</h2>
<p>Taskbit is a habit forming task timer designed to help you get sh*t done.</p>
<h2>Okay, but why?</h2>
<p>As a chronically disorganized person, I've found keeping to a daily schedule to be super important. <!--When I stick to daily routines, it brings an element of stability and focus to my life- and I see the difference.--> But like all things in life that are good for you, it often seems next to impossible to keep up with while operating like an actual human being, and more often than not is reduced to little more than another thing to guilt myself over.</p>
<p>I've noticed a pattern. Every few months or so in the middle of an existential crisis, often spurred by a BuzzFeed article like <i>5 Things This Self Starting Billionaire Does Every Morning</i> or <i>10 Totally Surprising Benefits of Cleaning Your Desk</i> (such clickbait related mental breakdowns are alarmingly common among millenials, trust me), I'll realize that I've been putting off too many things; letting too many important tasks fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>But there's really no reason for this. After all, this list of 10 Ways To Trick Yourself Into Being Productive is so simple! A 5 year old could do these things. <i>I graduated college</i>, I tell myself, <i>I am a fully functional adult.</i> Then I sit down and pencil out my grand plan: the daily schedule that will change everything. The tasks are so elegantly simple, yet effective and timed for maximum efficiency. <i>Make a daily schedule,</i> I said. <i>It will be fun,</i> I said.</p>
<p>Of course, within the week after maybe one or two days of gold-star effort I'm back to putting off those chores, procrastinating on those personal projects, and scrambling on laundry day.</p>
<p>Clearly, the list wasn't working for me.</p>
<p>Clearly, I needed something smarter. Something that can anticipate my laziness.</p>
<p>Enter the wonderful world of technology. Because my parents didn't put me through 4 years of nerd school for nothing! TaskBit is a daily schedule app designed to keep you going, even when the distractions are painfully real. Maybe you don't need this app. Maybe you can make it through a to-do list without falling down a Wikipedia rabbit hole. Maybe you're a self starting billionaire who wakes up early and goes for a run while chanting positive affirmations to yourself and contemplating all the good in the world. I'll be over here programming my cellphone to do that for me.</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<h3>Creating Your Routine</h3>
<p>Start by typing in the task name and duration (in seconds) in the fields in the task table, and press ADD when you're done.</p>
<p>If you want to add more tasks, just click ADD TASK and repeat.</p>
<p>If you want to re-order your tasks, just click and press until the desired task turns grey. Then drag and drop it anywhere on the list.</p>
<p>When you're satisfied with your schedule, click SAVE SCHEDULE at the bottom of the list. All of your schedules will be saved to your browser, so you can come back to it next time!</p>
<p>If you want to create a new routine, click the + at the top left next to your existing schedules.</p>
<h3>Using Your Routine</h3>
<p>To begin your routine, you can press the START button at the top of the list, or click an individual task anywhere on the list to begin the timer there.</p>
<p>Once started, the timer will tick down the seconds until the end of that task. When it's completed, TaskBit will alert you with a calming sound (and two long buzzes on mobile) to begin the next task. The timer for the next task will begin automatically until you reach the end of your list.</p>
<h3>What if I need more time?</h3>
<p>There are PAUSE and STOP buttons positioned at the top of the list for your convenience which will appear after the timer has begun. You can click them at any time, or click on the same task again to re-start the timer.</p>
<h3>It Says My Durations Aren't Displayed Correctly!</h3>
<p>Are you writing the duration in seconds? Unfortunately we don't accept formatted times yet (but this is a feature that will be released before v.1.0! Pinky promise!)
